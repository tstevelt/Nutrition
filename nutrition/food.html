<p>
Setup a recipe of multiple foods, then copy it to a food.<br>
For example, make a recipe for a sandwich using bread, mayo, tuna etc. Copy it to a food named 'Tuna Sandwich'.<br>
This makes entering foods for a daily meal easier, since you only need to add the one item instead of all the ingredients.<br>
