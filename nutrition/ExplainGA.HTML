This report uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find a good solution from the trillions of possible combinations of foods which closely match your macro targets.  If you are selecting commonly used foods, then the report runs quickly.  If you select from all foods, then it will take about 30 seconds to find a good solution.  There are many possible good solutions to this problem, so every time you run the report, it will give you a different list of foods.
